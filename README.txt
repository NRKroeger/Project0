Wireframes AB are my 2 different wireframes based on time and functionality

Initially I intended to make a fed different web pages and have images for specific animals
but I was not comfortable with the petfinder API (its documentations was laregly about json and not
html implementation)

Also note: the "cool" button is functional and just prints a line about cats being cool on click

Short Video of website included incase of API key deprecation
